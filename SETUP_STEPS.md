## 📋 Steps to Complete

### 1. Initial Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   
   # Windows Command Prompt
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   
   # Linux/Mac
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root:
   ```bash
   # Copy the template
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit `.env` and update at minimum:
   - `SECRET_KEY` - Generate a secure random key: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`
   - Other values as needed
   
   See `.env.example` for all available configuration options including:
   - Flask settings (host, port, debug mode)
   - Logging configuration
   - Booking system settings (operating hours, timezone, duration limits)
   - Feature flags (AI Concierge, registration)
   - Production settings
   
   **Note:** The database (`campus_resource_hub.db`) is included with the project and contains sample/starter data to help you get started quickly. The default admin account credentials are:
   - Email: `admin@iu.edu`
   - Password: `Admin123!`
   
   Additional sample users may be included in the database with various email addresses. Check the User Management page after logging in to see all available accounts.

### 2. Test Basic Functionality
1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   - Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
   - Try logging in with the admin account (included in sample data)
   - Register a new user account
   - Explore the sample resources and bookings
   - Create a test resource
   - Make a test booking

### 3. Environment Setup

#### A. AI Concierge Setup (Optional)
The AI Concierge uses Google Gemini for natural language resource queries:
1. Get a Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Add it to your `.env` file as `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
3. The chatbot will use a fallback search-based response if no API key is provided

#### B. Database Notes
- The database (`campus_resource_hub.db`) is included with the project and contains sample/starter data
- The database includes sample resources, users, bookings, and other data to help you get started
- All database migrations have been completed
- Migration scripts are archived in the `archive/` folder for reference
- The `init_db.py` script is available if you need to recreate the database from scratch

   - Set `PRODUCTION=1` and `FLASK_DEBUG=0` for production
   - Configure all booking system settings as needed
   - See `.env.example` for complete documentation and all available options

2. **Database:**
   - Consider migrating to PostgreSQL for production
   - Set up database backups

3. **Static files:**
   - Consider using CDN for Bootstrap/CSS
   - Optimize images

4. **Security:**
   - Change default admin password
   - Enable HTTPS
   - Configure secure cookies
   - Set up rate limiting
   - Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is strong and unique
   - Review `archive/ERROR_HANDLING_REFACTORING.md` for error handling best practices (reference documentation)

5. **Logging:**
   - Configure log directory and rotation
   - Set up log monitoring/alerting
   - Review logs regularly for errors

## 🎯 Quick Reference

### Default Admin Account
- **Email:** admin@iu.edu
- **Password:** Admin123!
- **⚠️ CHANGE THIS IN PRODUCTION!**

**Note:** Additional sample users may be included in the database with various email addresses. You can view all users in the Admin Dashboard > User Management section.

### Key Files to Review/Edit
- `app.py` - Main Flask application
- `src/controllers/` - Route handlers (add image upload here)
- `src/views/admin/users.html` - Add modals here
- `src/services/` - Business logic (mostly complete)
- `src/static/css/main.css` - Customize styling if needed

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Database errors on first run
- **Solution:** Ensure the `campus_resource_hub.db` file exists in the project root. If it's missing, you can recreate it by running `python init_db.py`

**Issue:** Virtual environment not activating
- **Solution:** On Windows, you may need to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` in PowerShell before activating the virtual environment

**Issue:** Images not displaying
- **Solution:** Ensure the `uploads/` folder exists and has proper permissions

**Issue:** Admin modals not working
- **Solution:** Ensure Bootstrap JavaScript is loaded correctly

**Issue:** Booking conflicts not detected
- **Solution:** Check `src/services/booking_service.py` conflict detection logic
