## Empty Directories Status

The following directories were checked and found to be empty or unused:
- ✅ `src/views/ai_concierge/` - Empty (AI concierge uses chatbot widget, not a dedicated page)
- ✅ `docs/context/` - Empty directory structure - **ARCHIVED November 2025**

**Note:** Empty directories can be safely removed if desired, but keeping them doesn't cause issues.

## Summary

**Total Files/Directories Archived:** 18+ items
- 6 migration scripts
- 1 utility script
- 2 old templates
- 3 outdated documentation files
- 4 refactoring documentation files (archived November 2025)
- 1 generated artifacts directory (`htmlcov/` - 31 files, archived November 2025)
- 1 empty directory structure (`docs/context/`, archived November 2025)

**Archive Strategy:**
Files are archived rather than deleted to:
1. Preserve history and migration paths
2. Allow reference to old implementations
3. Maintain audit trail
4. Enable recovery if needed

The `archive/` folder is part of the repository and can be safely ignored in daily development.
